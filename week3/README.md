## 📌 What is Sass/SCSS?

**Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)** is a CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and modular file organization.  
It helps developers write cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable stylesheets.

Sass supports two syntaxes:
- **Sass (.sass)** → indentation-based syntax (no braces/semicolons)
- **SCSS (.scss)** → CSS-like syntax (most common in modern projects)

## ✅ Why Sass is used in professional projects

Sass is widely used because it improves:
- **Maintainability** → better organization and modular files
- **Scalability** → easy to grow styles as the project expands
- **Reusability** → mixins/functions reduce duplication
- **Consistency** → design tokens for spacing/colors/typography
- **Productivity** → utilities generation using loops and maps
- **Team workflows** → clear architecture and shared systems
